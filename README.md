# quasar-fire-operation

##### Dependencies
* JDK 15
* Mongo DB
* Docker(maybe, it's up to you)

##### Setup
This project will need the dependencies above to run. You can find the JDK 15 here: https://sdkman.io/ . I highly recommend you download this guy, you can find many SDKs from many languages. The MongoDB dependency it's up to you. I used a docker image  with the command below: 
* docker run -d --name mongodb -p 127.0.0.1:27017:27017 -d mongo:3.4.2

At least, it's a maven project, so you will need to have maven installed.
